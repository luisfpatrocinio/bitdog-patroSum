# bitdog-patroSum

PatroSum is an interactive addition game developed for the BitDogLab (RP2040) platform. Designed to run on the RP2040 microcontroller, it offers a fun way to practice and improve addition skills.

## Hardware Requirements

PatroSum is designed for the BitDogLab board. Most required components are integrated, except for the 4x4 matrix keypad, which must be connected externally:

- 4x4 matrix keypad (external, required for user input)
- Display (integrated)
- RGB LEDs (integrated)
- Buzzer (integrated)

Make sure to connect a 4x4 matrix keypad to use all features of the game. All other components are already present on the BitDogLab board.
